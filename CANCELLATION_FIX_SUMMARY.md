# Free Trial Cancellation Fix - Summary

## Problem Identified

The "Unable to access your account information" error occurred because:

1. **Missing Service Role Key**: The `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` was commented out in the `.env` file
2. **Mismatched Project Keys**: The environment had keys from different Supabase projects (kvgptvhspucsokvxwlql vs imxmvqxugbrhwxhfrmje)
3. **RLS Permission Issues**: The API was falling back to the anon key which doesn't have permissions to bypass Row Level Security

## Changes Made

### 1. Environment Configuration (`/.env`)
- ✅ Updated `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` to point to correct project: `https://imxmvqxugbrhwxhfrmje.supabase.co`
- ✅ Updated `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` to match the correct project
- ✅ Uncommented and set `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` with the correct service role key

### 2. API Route Improvements (`/app/api/cancel-subscription/route.ts`)
- ✅ Added `validateEnvironment()` function to check all required environment variables on startup
- ✅ Improved error logging with detailed context (userId, timestamps, duration)
- ✅ Added specific error handling for:
  - Permission/RLS errors
  - Authentication errors
  - Stripe errors
- ✅ Always uses service role key (no fallback to anon key)
- ✅ Added performance tracking with request duration logging
- ✅ Enhanced error messages to help with troubleshooting

### 3. Environment Validator (`/lib/env-validator.ts`)
- ✅ Created new utility to validate all required environment variables
- ✅ Provides clear logging of missing vs configured variables
- ✅ Can be used for health checks and troubleshooting

### 4. Documentation Updates (`/.env.example`)
- ✅ Added clear comments about Supabase configuration requirements
- ✅ Emphasized that all keys must be from the SAME Supabase project

### 5. Database Verification
- ✅ Verified RLS policies are correctly configured for service role
- ✅ Confirmed service role can read and update all profiles

## Testing Checklist

### For Free Trial Users (No Stripe Customer)
1. Log in as a user with `billing_status = 'trialing'` and no `stripe_customer_id`
2. Navigate to Settings page
3. Click "End Free Trial" button
4. Confirm the cancellation in the dialog
5. Verify:
   - ✅ Success message appears
   - ✅ `billing_status` changes to `'cancelled'`
   - ✅ `account_status` changes to `'suspended'`
   - ✅ User is redirected or sees suspended state

### For Paid Subscribers (With Stripe Customer)
1. Log in as a user with `stripe_customer_id` and active subscription
2. Navigate to Settings page
3. Click "Cancel Subscription" button

   - ✅ Success message appears
   - ✅ Stripe subscription is marked as `cancel_at_period_end = true`
   - ✅ `billing_status` changes to `'cancelled'`
   - ✅ Access continues until period end date

### Error Scenarios to Test
1. **Missing Environment Variable**
   - Temporarily comment out `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - Attempt cancellation
   - Should see: "Service is not properly configured"

2. **Invalid User ID**
   - Attempt cancellation with non-existent userId
   - Should see: "Your account information could not be found"

3. **Network Issues**
   - Simulate slow/failed database connection
   - Should see: "Unable to access your account information"

## Current State

### Database Status
- 5+ users in trialing status ready for testing
- RLS policies correctly configured
- Service role has full access to profiles table

### Environment Status
All required variables are now configured:
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- ✅ `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- ✅ `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- ✅ `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

### Build Status
- ✅ Project builds successfully with no errors
- ⚠️ Minor warnings about Tailwind CSS classes (non-critical)
- ⚠️ Supabase realtime dependency warnings (expected, non-critical)

## What Users Will Experience

## Monitoring & Logging

The improved API route now logs:
- ✅ Request initiation with timestamp
- ✅ Database query duration
- ✅ Success/failure of each operation
- ✅ Detailed error information for troubleshooting
- ✅ Whether service role key is being used

Check server logs for entries starting with `[Cancel Subscription]` to monitor the feature.

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Production**
   - Update production environment variables with correct Supabase keys
   - Verify service role key is configured
   - Test cancellation flow in production

2. **Monitor**
   - Watch server logs for any cancellation errors
   - Track cancellation success rate
   - Monitor for RLS permission errors

3. **User Communication**
   - Consider sending confirmation email after cancellation
   - Provide clear feedback about what happens to their data
   - Offer option to reactivate before trial period ends

## Support Resources

If users encounter issues:
1. Check server logs for `[Cancel Subscription]` entries
2. Verify environment variables are correctly set
3. Confirm database RLS policies are in place
4. Check that service role key matches the Supabase URL
5. Use the environment validator: `import { logEnvironmentStatus } from '@/lib/env-validator'`
