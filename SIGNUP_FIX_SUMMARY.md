# 🔒 Signup Fix & Security Summary

## ✅ Issue Fixed

**Problem:** Users received error: "new row violates row-level security policy for table 'profiles'"

**Root Cause:** When users signed up, the app tried to manually insert a profile row, but the RLS policy required an authenticated session that wasn't fully established yet.

**Solution:** Implemented automatic profile creation using a PostgreSQL trigger that runs when a new user is created in auth.users. This bypasses RLS timing issues and is the recommended Supabase pattern.

## 🔐 Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

All tables have RLS enabled with comprehensive policies:

#### **profiles** table
- ✅ SELECT: Users can only view their own profile
- ✅ UPDATE: Users can only update their own profile
- ✅ INSERT: Handled automatically by database trigger
- ✅ Trigger ensures profile created with correct user ID

#### **technicians** table
- ✅ SELECT: Users can only view their own technicians
- ✅ INSERT: Users can only create technicians for themselves
- ✅ UPDATE: Users can only update their own technicians
- ✅ DELETE: Users can only delete their own technicians

#### **jobs** table
- ✅ SELECT: Users can only view their own jobs
- ✅ INSERT: Users can only create jobs for themselves
- ✅ UPDATE: Users can only update their own jobs
- ✅ DELETE: Users can only delete their own jobs

#### **analytics_snapshots** table
- ✅ SELECT: Users can only view their own analytics
- ✅ INSERT: Users can only create analytics for themselves

#### **recommendations** table
- ✅ SELECT: Users can only view their own recommendations
- ✅ UPDATE: Users can only update their own recommendations

#### **stripe_customers** table
- ✅ RLS enabled
- ✅ Users can only access their own Stripe customer data

#### **stripe_subscriptions** table
- ✅ RLS enabled
- ✅ Users can only access their own subscription data

#### **stripe_orders** table
- ✅ RLS enabled
- ✅ Users can only access their own order history

#### **consultation_requests** table
- ✅ SELECT: Users can only view their own requests
- ✅ INSERT: Users can only create requests for themselves

#### **plans** table
- ✅ SELECT: All authenticated users can view plans (read-only)

#### **email_leads** table
- ✅ RLS enabled for marketing data protection

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Trigger (Automatic Profile Creation)

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.profiles (id, email, company_name, plan_tier, user_role, demo_mode)
  VALUES (
    NEW.id,
    NEW.email,
    COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'company_name', 'My Company'),
    COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'plan_tier', 'starter'),
    'owner',
    false
  );
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
  AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user();
```

**How it works:**
1. User signs up via `supabase.auth.signUp()`
2. Trigger automatically creates profile with user's ID
3. App updates profile with full details (company name, technician count, etc.)
4. No RLS timing issues - trigger runs with elevated privileges

### Updated Signup Flow

```typescript
export async function signUp(...) {
  // 1. Create auth user with metadata
  const { data: authData } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
    email,
    password,
    options: {
      data: {
        company_name: companyName,
        plan_tier: planTier,
      }
    }
  });

  // 2. Trigger automatically creates profile

  // 3. Update profile with full details
  await supabase.from('profiles').update({
    company_name: companyName,
    technician_count: technicianCount,
    plan_tier: planTier,
    demo_mode: true,
    user_role: 'owner',
  }).eq('id', authData.user.id);
}
```

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices Followed

### ✅ 1. Principle of Least Privilege
- Users can ONLY access their own data
- No user can read/write another user's information
- Stripe data is isolated per user

### ✅ 2. Defense in Depth
- RLS policies at database level (can't be bypassed from client)
- Authentication required for all protected routes
- Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity

### ✅ 3. Secure by Default
- All tables have RLS enabled
- No table allows public access (except plans for viewing)
- API keys properly scoped (anon key for client, service key for server)

### ✅ 4. Data Isolation
- User ID (`auth.uid()`) used as the security boundary
- All user-owned tables reference `profiles.id`
- Cascade deletes ensure clean data removal

### ✅ 5. Audit Trail
- All tables have `created_at` timestamps
- Most tables have `updated_at` timestamps
- Soft deletes available (`deleted_at`) for sensitive data

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Test User Signup
- [ ] Visit signup page
- [ ] Select a plan
- [ ] Enter company details
- [ ] Enter email and password
- [ ] Submit form
- [ ] ✅ User should be created without errors
- [ ] ✅ Profile should be created automatically
- [ ] ✅ Redirected to Stripe checkout

### Test Data Isolation
- [ ] Create User A and User B
- [ ] User A creates technicians and jobs
- [ ] User B creates technicians and jobs
- [ ] ✅ User A cannot see User B's data
- [ ] ✅ User B cannot see User A's data

### Test RLS Policies
- [ ] Try to access another user's profile via API
- [ ] ✅ Should return no data or error
- [ ] Try to update another user's data
- [ ] ✅ Should be blocked by RLS

## 📊 Database Schema Security

All tables follow this security model:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          auth.users (Supabase)          │
│         (Managed by Supabase)           │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────────┘
                  │
                  │ Trigger creates profile
                  ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              profiles                    │
│  RLS: auth.uid() = id                   │
│  User's master record                   │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────────┘
                  │
                  │ user_id FK
                  ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  technicians │ jobs │ analytics        │
│  RLS: auth.uid() = user_id              │
│  All user-owned data                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
