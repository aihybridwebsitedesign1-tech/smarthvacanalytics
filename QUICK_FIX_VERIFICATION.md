# Free Trial Cancellation - Fix Verification âœ…

## Issue Resolved
**Error**: "Unable to access your account information. Please try again."

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Environment Configuration âœ…
```bash

SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGc... (properly configured)
All keys now match the correct project
```

### 2. API Improvements âœ…

- Improved error logging with detailed context
- Always uses service role key (no fallback)
- Better error messages for troubleshooting
