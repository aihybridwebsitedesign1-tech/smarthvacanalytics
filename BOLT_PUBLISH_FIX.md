## Before Publishing Again

### 1. Make Sure Environment Variables Are Set

In Bolt.new project settings, ensure these variables are configured:

**Required:**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_value
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_value
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_value
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_value
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_value
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_value
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_STARTER_PRICE_ID=your_value
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_GROWTH_PRICE_ID=your_value
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID=your_value
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=your_value
```

### 2. Try Publishing Again

The error should now be resolved. Try publishing again in Bolt.new.

---

## If Error Persists

### Option 1: Check Build Locally
```bash
npm run build
```
If this succeeds, the issue is with Bolt.new deployment, not your code.

### Option 2: Check for Other Backup Files
```bash
find . -name "*.bak" -o -name "*.backup"
```
Delete any found with:
```bash
rm path/to/file.bak
```

### Option 3: Verify No Missing Files
Ensure all imported files exist:
```bash
# Check for broken imports
npm run typecheck
```

---

## What Got Excluded from Deployment

The `.boltignore` file now excludes:
- Test files and scripts
- Documentation files (except README)
- Backup files
- Build artifacts
- Node modules
- Environment files (use Bolt settings instead)

---

## Next Steps After Successful Publish

1. âœ… Publish succeeds
2. Set up custom domain (see `BOLT_CUSTOM_DOMAIN_SETUP.md`)
3. Configure production Stripe (see `QUICK_PRODUCTION_SETUP.md`)
4. Update webhook URL to custom domain
5. GO LIVE! ðŸš€

## Alternative: Manual Deployment

If Bolt.new continues having issues, you can deploy to Vercel:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel

# Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
# https://vercel.com/dashboard/[your-project]/settings/environment-variables
```

---

## Support

If you continue seeing deployment errors:
1. Copy the error ID Bolt.new provides
2. Contact Bolt.new support with the ID
3. Consider alternative deployment (Vercel, Netlify)

The application is production-ready - the issue is just with the deployment platform.
