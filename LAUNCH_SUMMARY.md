## 🆘 Common Launch Issues (and Solutions)

### "Domain not working"
**Solution:** Wait 30-60 min for DNS, clear browser cache

### "Stripe checkout fails"
**Solution:** Verify all keys are from LIVE mode, check webhook URL

### "Accounts stuck in trial"
**Solution:** Database trigger should prevent this, but can manually activate:
```sql
UPDATE profiles SET billing_status = 'active' WHERE plan_tier IN ('growth', 'pro');
```

### "Webhook not receiving events"
**Solution:** Update webhook URL to custom domain, verify signing secret
